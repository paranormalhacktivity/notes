# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with
pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of owning their own computing infrastructure or
data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage
from a cloud service provider.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

### Agility
Cloud computing allows for rapid provisioning of resources, enabling businesses to
quickly scale up or down as needed.

### Elasticity
Cloud services can be scaled elastically, both up or down, based on demand. This
means you only use and pay for the resources you need.

### Cost Savings
By using cloud services, companies can avoid the capital expense of buying hardware
and software and setting up and running on-site data centers.

### Global Reach
Cloud providers have data centers in various locations around the globe, enabling
businesses to deploy applications closer to users, reducing latency.

### Performance
Major cloud services run on a worldwide network of secure data centers, which are
regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing software.

### Reliability
Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier
and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud
provider's network.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Public Cloud
- Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across organizations.
- Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

### Private Cloud
Cloud computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization.
The private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site data center
or hosted by a third-party service provider.

### Hybrid Cloud
Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared
between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public
clouds, a hybrid cloud give businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
- Examples: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine.

### Platform as a Service(PaaS)
- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications
without the complexity of builing and maintaining the infrastructure typically
associated with developing and launching an app.
- Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine

### Software as a Service(SaaS)
- Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.
- Examples: Google Workspace, Salesforce

## Practical Example: AWS Services
To put these concepts into perspective, let's look at how AWS implements these models.

- AWS EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud): An example of IaaS, providing resizable compute
capacity in the cloud.

- AWS Lambda: An example of a serverless computing platform, fitting within both PaaS
and FaaS(Function as a Service).

- Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service): Provides scalable object storage.

- Amazon RDS(Relational Database Service): A managed relational database service,
simplifying database management tasks.

- Amazon Redshift: A fully managed data warehouse service.

### Key Terminology
- Virtualization: The creation of virtual versions of physical components like servers,
storage devices, and network resources.

- Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increase load by adding resources.

- Elasticity: The ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down
based on demand.

- Multi-Tenancy: The ability to serve multiple customers(tenants) from a single instance
of a software application, each tenant's data is isolated.
