# Binomial Theorem Formula

The binomial theorem is a fundamental concept in algebra that provides a way to
expand expressions of the form `(a + b )^n`, where `a` and `b` are constants, and
`n` is a positive integer. The binomial theorem formula enables us to expand these
expressions into a sum of terms, each involving powers of `a` and `b`. This theorem
is particularly useful for simplifying and evaluating expressions involving polynomial
powers.

## Formula:
For any positive integer `n` and constants `a` and `b`, the expansion of `(a + b)^n` is
given by:

```
(a + b)^n = C(n, 0) * a^n * b^0 + C(n, 1) * a^(n-1) * b^1 + ... + C(n, n-1) * a^1 * b(^(n-1) + C(n, n) * a^0 * b^n
```

Where:
- `C(n, k)` represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k", which is the number of ways
to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items. It can be calculated as `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`,
where `n!` is the factorial of `n`. See "Combination" notes for more info.
- `a^n` represents `a` raised to the power of `n`
- `b^k` represents `b` raised to the power of `k`

## Explanation
The binomial theorem formula captures the relationship between the coefficients of the
expanded terms and the powers of `a` and `b`. The terms are constructed by combining these
coefficients with the appropriate powers of `a` and `b`. The powers of `a` decrease from `n`
down to `0`, while the powers of `b` increses from `0` up to `n`.

The formula can be visually understood as follows:
- The first term involves `a^n` and `b^0, and it's multiplied by the binomial coefficient
`C(n, 0)`.
- The second term involves `a^(n-1)` and `b^1`, and it's multiplied by the binomial coefficient
`C(n, 1)`.
- This pattern continues until the last term, which involves `a^0` and `b^m`, and it's multiplied
by the binomial coefficient `C(n, n)`

## Application
The binomial theorem is used to simplify expressions involving powers of binomials, which often appear
in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields. It allows us to quickly expand and evaluate
these expressions without having to perform repeated multiplication. This theorem plays a crucial role
in areas such as algebra, combinatorics, calculus, and probability.

In summary, the binomial theorem provides a systemic and efficient method for expanding
binomial expressions, offering insight into the relationships between coefficients and powers
of terms within these expansions.
