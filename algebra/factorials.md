# Factorials
Factorials are a fundamental concept in mathematics that play a crucial role in
various areas, including combinatorics, calculus, and number theory. A factorial
of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers
from `1` to `n`.

## Definition
The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is defined as:
```
n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2 * 1
```

For example:
- `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`
- `0! = 1`(by definition)

## Properties and Significance
Factorials have several important properties and applications in mathematics:
1. Combinatorics: Factorials are often used to count the number of ways to arrange
or choose items from a set. For example, `n!` represents the number of permutations of `n`
distinct items.
2. Binomial Coefficients: Factorials are used in binomial coefficients(combinations). The
formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)` involves factorials and represents the number of
ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items.
3. Series Expansion: Factorials appear in series expansions like the Taylore series in
calculus. They are used to express functions as infinite sums of terms involving derivatives.
4. Number Theory: Factorials have connections to prime numbers, divisibility, and number
properties. They are used in various number-theoretic concepts.
5. Gamma Function: The gamma function is a generalization of the factorial function to
complex numbers. It has applications in advanced mathematical analysis and physics.

## Factorial Notation
- `n!` is read as "n factorial".
- `0!` is defined to be `1`.

## Factorials and Large Numbers
Factorials grow rapidly as `n` increases. For large values of `n`, `n!` becomes very large.
This growth is used to represent combinations and permutations in larger scenarios.

## Conclusion
Factorials are a fundamental mathematical concept with diverse applications in various
mathematical disciplines. They are use to count arrangements, combinations, and series
expansians. Understanding factorials is essential for solving problems involving counting,
probability, calculus, and more.
