# Equalities

An equality is a mathematical statement that two expressions are the same, indicated by
the equals sign(=). It asserts that the quantities on both sides of the equal sign
have the same value. Solving an equality means finding the value(s) of the variable(s)
that make the statement true.

## Solving Equalities

- To solve an equality, isolate the variables on one side of the equation.
- Use inverse operations (opposite operations) to undo each opperation applied to the variable.
- The goal is to get the variable by itself on one side and the constant on the other.
  example:
    Solve `2x + 3 = 7`
    1. Subtract 3 from both sides: `2x = 4`
    2. Divide both sides by 3: `x = 2`

# Inequalities

An inequality is a mathematical statement that two expressions are not necessarily
equal, indicated by inequality symbols such as < (less than), > (greater than),
<= (less than or equal to), or >= (greater than or equal to). Inequalities express
relationships between quantities that can be greater, less, or equal. Solving an
inequality means finding that range of values for which the statement holds true.

## Solving Inequalities

- Solve inequalities similarly to equalities, but remember that multiplication or division
by a negative number reverses the inequality sign.
  example:
    Solve `-3x - 5 > 10`
    1. Add 5 to both sides: `-3x > 15`
    2. Divide both sides by -3, not forgetting to flip the inequality symbol: `x < -5`

## Graphing Equalities and Inequalities

### On a number line
- An equality is represented by a single point where the values are equal.
- Inequalities are represented by shaded reqions. An open circle indicates "less than" or "greater
than", while a closed circle indicates "less than or equal to" or "greater than or equal to".

### On a coordinate plane
- An equality for linear and quadratic equations, is represented by a line that passes through
a particular set of coordinates, that satisfy the equation.
- Inequalities, similarly to the number line, are represented by shaded regions. First,
the inequality must be converted to an equality, and that equation must be graphed out, then,
depending on if the inequality is greater than or less than, the area above or below must
be shaded, above for "greater than" and below for "less than". Also important to note that
if the inequality is "greater than or equal to" or "less than or equal to", it is represented as
a solid line, but if it is just "greater than" or "less than", it is represented as
a dashed line.
