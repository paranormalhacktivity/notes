# Expressions
An expression is a mathematical phrase that contains numbers, variables, and operations.
Expressions can represent values, computations, or relationships.

## Parts of an Expression
- Constants: Fixed numerical values. Example: `5, -2, 3.14`
- Variables: Symbols representing unknown or changing values. Example: `x, y, a`
- Coefficients: The numerical factor in front of a variable. Example: `2x, 2 is the coefficient of x`
- Terms: Parts of an expression separated by addition or subtraction.
  - Monomial: A single term. Example: `4x or -3y`
  - Binomial: Two terms connected by + or -. Example: `2x - 3y or 3x + 4`
  - Trinomial: Three terms connected by + or -. Example: `x^2 + 5x + 2`
  - Polynomial: Expression with one or more terms. Example: `3x^2 - 5x + 2 or or 2y or 5x + 2`.

## Operations with Expressions
- Addition and Subtraction: Combine like terms.
  - Like Terms: Terms with the same variable(s) raised to the same exponent(s). Example: `3x and -5x are like terms`
- Multiplication: Use the distributive property to multiply.
  - Distributive Property: `a(b + c) = ab + ac`
- Exponents: Represent repeated multiplication.
  - x^n: x raised to the power of n. Example: `x^3 means x * x * x`

## Evaluating Expressions
- Substitute specific values for variables and simplify
- Follow "Order of Operations", otherwise known as "PEMDAS/BODMAS" when evaluating.
  1. Parenthesis/Brackets
  2. Exponents/Orders
  3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
  4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)


### Practice problems
- Simplify 5x + 2y - 3x + 4y.
  1. Combine like terms: (5x - 3x) + (2y + 4y) = 2x + 6y

  Answer: `2x + 6y`

- Evaluate 3x^2 - 2y for x = -2 and y = 3.
  1. Substitute: 3(-2)^2 - 2(3)
  2. Evaluate exponents: 3(4) - 2(3)
  3. Distribute: 12 - 6
  4. Combine like terms: 6

  Answer: `6`

- Simplify 2(3x - 5) - 4(2x + 1)
  1. Distribute: 6x - 10 - 8x - 4
  2. Combine like terms: -2x - 14

  Answer: `-2x - 14`
