# Algebra

## what is algebra?
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the symbols and the rules for
manipulating those symbols to solve equations and study relationships between variables.
It involves using letters (called variables) to represent unknown quantities and using
mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to
perform calculations and solve problems.

Algebra provides a framework for expressing and analyzing mathematical relationships in a
general and abstract way. It plays a crucial role in various fields of mathematics, science,
engineering, and other disciplines, serving as a foundatiuon for more advanced mathematical
concepts. Algebraic techniques are used to model real-world situations, make predictions, and
solve a wide range of problems, from basic arithmetic to complex equations and systems of
equations.

### Focus

between variables.

### Concepts
It involves working with equations, inequalities, polynomials, functions, and graphs.
Algebraic techniques are used to simplify expressions, factor polynomials, solve equations,
and analyze patterns.

### Importance
Algebra provides a foundational understanding of mathematical reasoning and is essential for
higher-level mathematics and various scientific and engineering fields.
