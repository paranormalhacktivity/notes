# Factors
In mathematics, a factor of a number is an integer that divides the given number
exactly, leaving no remainder.

example: For the number 12, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 because these
numbers can divide 12 without leaving a remainder.

## Prime Factorization
"Prime Factorization" is expressing a number as the product of its prime factors.

example: The prime factorization of 12 is `2 x 2 x 3` or `2^2 x 3`

## Common Factors
These are factors that two or more numbers share.

example: Common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

## Greatest Common Factor(GCF)
This is the largest factor that two or more numbers share.

example: The GCF of 12 and 18 is 6.

## Multiples and Factors
A multiple of a number is the result of multiplying that number by any integer.

example: Multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, ...

## Finding Factors
To find factors, consider pairs of numbers whose product is the given number.

example: Factors of 24 are found by considering pairs like (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), and (4,6).

## Special Cases
- Prime Numbers: Have only two factors, 1 and the number itself.
- Composite Numbers: Have more than two factors.
- 1 and 0: Unique cases where 1 has only one factor, and is a factor of every number.

## Applications
- Mathematics: Essential for simplifying fractions, solving equations, and understanding
number relationships
- Algebra: Factoring is crucial for simplifying algebraic expressions and solving equations.

     2   6
        / \
       2   3
```
The prime factorization of 24 is `2 x 2 x 2 x 3` or `2^3 x 3`

Understanding factors is fundamental to various mathematical concepts, including
simplifying expressions, solving equations, and working with fractions. Prime factorization,
in particular, is a powerful tool in number theory and algebra.
