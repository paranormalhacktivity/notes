##### Bound Method:
A bound method is a concept in object-oriented programming language. It refers to
a method(a function defined within a class) that has been associated with a specific
object instance. When you access a method through an object instance, you get a bound
method object, which includes a reference to both the method itself and the object
instance it is bound to. Bound methods typically have special attributes that provide
access to the underlying function and the object on which the method operates. This concept
allows for the encapsulation of both behavior and state within an object-oriented framework.

##### Double-precision floating point numbers:
These numbers are represented in memory using 64 bits(8 bytes). They have a larger
range and precision compared to single-precision numbers, meaning they can represent
a wider range of values and have more precision in representing decimal numbers. They
are commonly used in most general-purpose computing scenarios where accuracy and precision
are important, such as in financial calculations, engineering simulations, and scientific
computations.

##### Single-precision floating point numbers:
These numbers are represented in memory using 32 bits(4 bytes). They have a smaller
range and precision compared to double-precision numbers, which means they can
represent a smaller range of values and have less precision in representing decimal
numbers. They are typically used in scenarios where memory and processing power are
limited, such as embedded systems or some scientific computations where the extra
precision of double-precision numbers is not necessary.

##### Unbound method:
An unbound method is a concept in object-oriented programming language. It refers to
a method that is defined within a class but not associated with a specific instance of
that class. It can be accessed directly from the class itself and does not retain a reference
to any particular instance.
