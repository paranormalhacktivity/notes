## Characteristics
An emergency fund is an essential safety net that provides you with peace of mind
and financial security during unexpected situations. To be effective, an emergency
fund should have specific characteristics.

*Liquidity*: An emergency fund should be easily accessible. You should be able to withdraw
funds quickly and without penalties. This means keeping the money in cash, a savings
account, or a money market account.

*Separate Account*: It's advisable to maintain your emergency fund in a separate account
from your regular checking or savings accounts. This separation helps prevent you from
using the funds for non-emergencies.

*Adequate Size*: Your emergency fund should be of an adequate size to cover essential
living expenses for a defined period. Common advice is to have enough to cover 3-6 months'
worth of living expenses, but the exact amount may vary based on your individual circumstances.

*Secure and Low-Risk*: The emergency fund should be held in low-risk, stable accounts,
that are not subject to market fluctuations. This typically means avoiding investments
with higher volatility like stocks.
