# Compound Interest

Compound Interest is the interest earned on both the initial principal (the original
amount of money) and the accumulated interest from previous periods. It allows your
money to grow exponentially over time.

## Key Elements
- Principal(P): The initial amount of money deposited or invested.
- Interest Rate(r): The percentage rate at which interest is applied to the principal. It
is expressed as a decimal(e.g. 5% becomes 0.05).
- Compounding Period(n): The frequency at which interest is calculated and added to the
principal. It could be annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, etc.
- Time(t): The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed, typically measured in years.

## Compound Interest Formula
The compound interest formula is used to calculate the future value of an investment,
taking into account the initial principal, interest rate, compounding period, and time.

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```
A: The future value of the investment/loan, including both the principal and interest.
P: The initial principal.
r: The annual interest rate.
n: The number of times that interest is compounded per year.
t: The time the money is invested for, in years.

## Key Concepts
- The Power of Compounding: Compound interest allows your money to grow faster over
time because you earn interest on both your initial investment and the interest that accumulates.
- Frequency of Compounding: The more frequently interest is compounded, the faster your
money grows. For example, monthly compounding yields more than annual compounding at the same
nominal rate.
- Effect of Time: Compound interest is most effective over longer periods. The longer your money
compounds, the more it grows.

## Considerations
- Start Early: The earlier you start investing or saving, the more time your money has to
compound and grow.
- Consistency Matters: Regular contributions or deposits to your investment or savings account
can significantly impact the growth through compound interest.
- Be Mindful of Fees: High fees or charges can reduce the overall impact of compound interest,
so it's important to choose investments or savings vehicles wisely.
