MAO(max allowable offer) = ARV(After-repair value) - Rehab - Money Costs - Closing Costs(2-3%) - Holding Costs(Utilites, tax, insurance, etc.) - Realtor Fees - Profit

## Rehab
$10/sqft = Light Rehab
$15/sqft = Lipstick Rehab
$25/sqft = Full Interior Rehab
$30/sqft = Full Interior & Exterior Rehab

Example:
  ARV = $400,000
  Rehab = $60,000
  Money Cost(300_000 * 0.01 * 5months) = $15,000
  Closing Cost = $12,000
  Holding Cost = $5,000
  Realtor(5% of ARV) = $20,000
  Profit(10% of ARV) = $40,000

  MAO = $248,000
