# Networking
Networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices to
share resources and information. This can be done through various types of networks,
including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the internet.

## Types of Networks
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network that is limited to a small geographic area,
such as a single building or a campus.
- WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans a larger geographic area, connecting LANs across cities,
countries, or even continents.
- Internet: A global network that connects millions of private, public, academic,
business, and government networks.

## Networking Devices
- Router: Connects different networks together and directs data traffic between them.
- Switch: Connects devices within the same network, allowing them to communicate with
each other.
- Hub: An older device that connects multiple devices in a LAN but operates at a lower
level than a switch.
- Modem: Converts digital data from a computer into the analog signal required for internet
communication over telephone lines or cable systems.

## Protocols
- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The fundamental suite of
protocols that powers the internet.
- HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure): Used for transmitting web pages
and other content on the World Wide Web. See `notes/web/http.md` and `notes/web/https.md`.
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between computers on a
network.
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending email.

## IP Addresses
- IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): The most widely used version of IP, expressed
as four sets of numbers separated by dots(e.g. 192.168.0.1).
- IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): Developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4
addresses, expressed in hexadecimal notation.

## Subnetting
Dividing an IP network into sub-networks to improve performance and security.

## Firewalls
Hardware or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic
based on predetermined security rules.

## Wireless Networking
Involves the use of wireless signals (Wi-Fi) to connect devices instead of physical
cables.

## Security
Network security involves protecting data during transmission and preventing unauthorized
access to networks and systems.

## Cloud computing
Utilizes network infrastructure to deliver computing services over the internet,
such as storage, processing power, and applications.
