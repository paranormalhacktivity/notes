# Cookie Manipulation
Cookie manipulation involves altering cookies to change or exploit the data they store,
often with the intent of bypassing security mechanisms or gaining unauthorized access
to restricted information or functionality.

## Types of Cookies

### Session Cookies
Temporary cookies that are deleted when the browser is closed. Used to maintain
session state between requests.

### Persistent Cookies
Remain on the user device for a set period or until deleted. Used for long-term storage
of user preferences login tokens etc.

### Secure Cookies
Can only be transmitted over HTTPS connections

### HttpOnly Cookies
Cannot be accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of client-side attacks like XSS.

## Common Cookie Manipulation

### Cookie Poisoning
- Definition: Altering the value of a cookie to inject malicious data or exploit
vulnerabilities.

- Example: Changing user roles or privileges by modifying a cookie value (e.g.
changing `role=user` to `role=admin`)

### Session Hijacking
- Definition: Stealing or guessing a session cookie to impersonate another user.

- Example: Using an intercepted session ID to take over a legitimate user's session

### Session Fixation
- Definition: Forcing a user to use a known session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack
the session once the user logs in.

- Example: Attacker provides a link with a fixed session ID; once the user logs in, the
attacker can access their session.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Definition: Injecting malicious scripts into a web page, which can then steal cookies.

- Examples: Injecting JavaScript that reads and sends cookies to the attacker's server.

### Replay Attacks
- Definition: Reusing intercepted cookies to replicate a session.

- Example: Replaying an intercepted authentication cookie to bypas login.

## Mitigation Techniques

### Encrypt Cookies
Encrypt cookie values to prevent tampering. Even if an attacker modifies a cookie, the
server won't be able to decrypt the tampered value, making it invalid.

### Use HttpOnly and Secure Flags
Set the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent Javascript access and the `Secure` flag to ensure
cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

### Validate Cookie Data
Always validate and sanitize cookie data server-side to prevent injection attacks.

### Regenerate Session IDs
Regenerate session IDs after user login to prevent session fixation.

### Implement Expiration and Invalidations
Use short-lived session cookies and invalidate them after logout or inactivity.

### Monitor for Anomalies
Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual cookie activity or session anomalies.

## Real-World Examples

### Privilege Escalation via Cookie Manipulation
A web application stores user roles in cookies. By tampering with the cookie value,
an attacker elevates their privileges from `user` to `admin`.

### Session Hijacking on Public Wi-Fi
An attacker on the same network intercepts a session cookie sent over an unsecured
connection, allowing them to take over the session.

## Ethical Considerations
Cookie manipulation can be a severe security risk if exploited maliciously. Developers
should implement best practices to protect against such attacks and regularly audit
their applications to ensure cookie data is secure.

## Conclusion
Cookie manipulation is a critical security concern that requires careful handling and
mitigation. Properly securing cookies and validating data can help protect web applications
from potential attacks.
