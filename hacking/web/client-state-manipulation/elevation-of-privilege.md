# Elevation of Privilege Attack in Web Applications
An Elevation of Privilege(EoP) attack occurs when an attacker gains higher levels of access
or permissions than originally intended. In the context of a web application, this typically
involves a user with limited privileges (e.g. a standard user) exploiting vulnerabilities to
perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users (e.g. administrators).
This kind of attack can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of system
configurations, and control over other users' accounts.

## How Elevation of Privilege Attacks Work
Elevation of Privilege attacks usually exploit flaws in the web application's access
control mechanisms, input validation, or configuration settings. Below are common
techniques used in these attacks.

## Exploiting Insecure Direct Object References(IDOR)

### Description
Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when an application exposes references
to internal objects (such as files, directories, or database records) without proper access
control checks. If a user can directly modify these references belonging to other users
or escalate their privileges.

### Example
A web application allows users to manage their accounts via URLs like:
```
https://example.com/user/12345/edit
```
If the application doesn't validate that the user has permission to edit the account
with ID `12345`, an attacker could change the ID in the URL another user's ID:
```
https://example.com/user/54321/edit
```

### Impact
The attacker could now edit another user's account details, potentailly escalating
privileges if they manage to change roles or permissions.

## Abusing Misconfigure Role-Based Access Control(RBAC)

### Description
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions to users based on their roles.
However, if the RBAC implementation is flawed or misconfigured, users might gain access
to resources or actions that should be restricted.

### Example
A web application might have roles such as `user`, `moderator`, and `admin`. If an
API endpoint allows users to update their own role without proper validation.
```
POST /api/users/updateRole
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```
An attacker could could gain administrative privileges, allowing them to access and
control sensitive parts of the application.

## Privilege Escalation via Parameter Manipulation

### Description
Parameter manipulation involves altering the values of parameters sent in HTTP requests
(such as form fields, cookies, or URL parameters) to escalate privileges.

### Example
A web application allows users to update their profile details via a form that includes
a hidden field for `role`. If the application does not enforce proper validation, an
attacker could modify the form's HTML to change the `role` parameter before submitting.
```
<input type="hidden" name="role" value="admin">
```

### Impact
The attacker's account could be upgraded to an admin role, granting them higher
privileges.

## Exploiting Vulnerabilities inAccess Control Mechanisms

### Description
Flaws in access control mechanisms, such as improper enforcement of permissions or
incomplete authorization checks, can be exploited to perform actions reserved for
higher-privileged users.

### Example
A web application might have a feature that allows administrators to delete user accounts.
If the authorization check is improperly implemented, a regular user might be able to
access the deletion endpoint.
```
DELETE /api/admin/deleteUser?userId=54321
```

### Impact
The attacker could delete other users' accounts, leading to denial of service or data
loss.

## Leveraging Vulnerable API Endpoints

### Description
API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization checks can be exploited
to perform actions with elevated privileges.

### Example
An API provides administrative actions like user management or configuration changes but
fails to restrict access to these endpoints properly.
```
POST /api/admin/addUser
{
    "username": "attacker",
    "role": "admin"
}
```

### Impact
The attacker could create an admin account for themselves or modify application settings,
gaining full control over the application.

## Exploiting Session Management Flaws

### Description
Session management flaws, such as session fixation hijacking, can allow attackers to
impersonate higher-privileged users.

### Example
An attacker tricks a privileged user into logging in with a session ID controlled by the
attacker. After the user logs in, the attacker can use the same session ID to access the
application with the victim's privileges.

### Impact
The attacker could access sensitive data, perform administrative actions, or manipulate
other users' accounts.

## Privilege Escalation via Software Exploits

### Description
Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying software (e.g. the web server, database, or
application framework) can allow attackers to escalate privileges.

### Example
An attacker finds a buffer overflow vulnerability in the web server that allows them to
execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Impact
The attacker could gain full control over the server, potentially compromising the entire
application and its data.

## Preventative Measures
To protect against Elevation of Privilege attacks, consider implementing the following
best practices:

### Implement Strong Access Controls
Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to enforce
strict access policies. Ensure that all access control checks are performed on the server
side.

### Validate and Sanitize Inputs
Validate all inputs, including parameters, cookies, and form fields, to prevent unauthorized
modifications.

### Use Strong Parameterization
Implement strong parameterization to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities, especially
when dealing with sensitive attributes like roles or permissions.

### Regularly Audit and Test Access Controls
Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix access control
vulnerabilities.

### Log and Monitor Privileged Actions
Implement logging and monitoring for all actions involving sensitive operations or
changes in privileges. Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

### Secure API Endpoints
Ensure that all API endpoints are properly authenticated and authorized, especially those
that perform administrative or sensitive actions.

### Patch and Update Software
Keep all software, including web servers, databases, and application frameworks, up to date
with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
Elevation of Privilege attacks can have severe consequences, allowing attackers to gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify system configurations, and control other
users' accounts. By understanding the common techniques used in these attacks and implementing
robust security measures, web applications developers can significantly reduce the risk of
privilege escalation and protect their applications from unauthorized access.
